  <h1>
    Thoughts on The Last Jedi
  </h1>
  <p>
    Where to even begin with episode VIII..  This was the most aggressively devisive film within any fanbase that I have been aware of.  Here we see the fruit of
    the bad seed planted at the executive level at Disney.  When JJ Abrams wrote Episode VII, he wrote out an outline for what he expected the trilogy to cover,
    including all the plot points that he started in VII. Episode VIII's director Rian Johnson decided to take the series in a new direction and ignore most of JJ's plan.
    There was a lot of good because of this, and lots of bad. Because I need some table content in my practice assignment I will list some pros and cons in a table.

    From that list you may get the sense of frustration that many experienced after seeing the movie.  Much of it felt like it was written to spite the fanbase, and I'm
    afraid to say that I believe it was.  Somehow Rian Johnson came on board the project with the idea that he had been handed one movie in an episodic
    series that would continue to be reworked and revamped regardless of what he did.  In short he treated it like a James Bond movie, where he could come make a splash
    in the series, and later other directors would do the same, without having to worry about an overarching story or plot.  He did not treat it like the lead up to the
    conclusion of a 9 part story.  This should have been the penultimate chord with the leading tone thrusting us towards a well built and prepared ending.  Instead he
    wanted to "subvert expectations" for Star Wars movies.  In one of the most classic storys of good vs evil, depicting the good Jedi vs the evil Sith, he decided that
    dumping that on its head was the best way to make a name for himself as a director.  So instead of pushing us towards a new, more nuanced ending, he disregarded JJ's
    interesting plot points for the shock of it, then pooped on all of the fans by saying Jedi aren't actually the good solution, then just to pull the rug out from
    under us again, he finished it by saying, just kidding, haha, they are the good guys.  The convolution of it all makes it hard to even describe.  All of this was done
    to intentionally make a splash in the genre, by going against the grain.  I can't imagine what possesed the executives and producers to allow the movie to go in any
    direction the director wanted without any oversight to make sure that the overarching plot would still make sense. Not only did they throw out the Legend storylines,
    and George Lucas' storyline, but Rian Johnson also threw out JJ Abrams' storyline just to slap us in the face with it.
